        <h2>Events & Projects</h2>
        <p>At Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester, we believe that Slovak culture should be experienced, not just learned. That’s why we organise a variety of events for everyone—families, children, adults, and individuals who simply want to connect with Slovak heritage, make new friends, and enjoy great company.</p>
        <p>Whether you’re a parent wanting to engage your child in Slovak traditions, a single professional looking to expand your social circle, or someone who just loves Slovak culture, our variety of events and workshops provides a welcoming space where people can enjoy themselves, have fun, eat traditional Slovak food, and build lasting connections.</p>
        <p>Some come for the cultural experience, some come to practice their Slovak, and others just come to enjoy good company over a coffee or a glass of wine. Whatever your reason, you are always welcome.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
        <p>Join us for our upcoming events—come with friends or come alone; you’ll always find a warm and friendly group to welcome you.</p>

        <h4>Easter Workshop (6th April)</h4>

Join us in decorating eggs using traditional Slovak techniques, creating beautiful Easter crafts, and learning about the unique customs that make Slovak Easter so special.</p>
        <p>But this event is more than just a workshop—it's also a social gathering where you can meet new people, enjoy great company, and experience a warm community atmosphere. Whether you're coming with friends, family, or on your own, you’ll find a friendly, relaxed environment where connections happen naturally over delicious Slovak food and drinks.</p>
        <p>To make the afternoon even more special, we will have music playing throughout the event and, if all goes to plan, we hope to welcome a special guest.</p>
